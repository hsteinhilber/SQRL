SQRL for Windows 8.1
====================

What is SQRL?
-------------
SQRL (pronounced "squirrel") stands for (S)ecure (Q)uick (R)eliable (L)ogin. It is a new
login technology meant to eliminate many of the common issues we currently experience
with traditional username and password style logins. It is extremely simple to use and
completely secure.

How does it work?
-----------------
When a user wants to log in to a website, they will typically be presented with a login
form consisting of a username and password. The user will enter their information into the
browser, click on login and they are logged in to the website. 

By logging in this way, the user must trust both the website to store their username and 
password and not lose it (via hackers or other means), and they also must trust the computer
and browser they are logging in with no to leak their credentials either.

Now enter SQRL: the user sees the same login page, but now it has a SQRL QR code next to the 
login. If the computer has a SQRL client installed with the user's identity, they can just
click on the QR code and the user is logged in. If the computer is not a trusted one, or does
not have a SQRL client installed, then the user can pull out their mobile device, snap a picture
of the QR code using their SQRL client and click on the log in button. That's it. The user is
now securely logged in to the website without providing any sensitive information to either the
computer, browser, or website!
